    maintain code to which I will never use again.  The Venom repo will be updated so
    Kodi 18 users can still access an 18 version, but it will no longer be developed.
    Matrix users will have access to a new github branch for future development.[/I]

    the userdata settings.xml.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Color settings for torrents, hosters, and direct links has been removed in favor of the contrast skin

    the required artwork for the skin.  From widgets, or inside Venom, there will be no overhead
    added as the needed meta is already available.  If you are a library user the needed meta is
    now pulled from the Kodi db so I encourage you to use the TMDb scraper, from the official
    Kodi repo, and enable fanart.tv for the extended artwork, which I pull out of the db during
    this process.[/I]

    watched when it is not.  This is more an AuraMod bug workaround.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The above item has added a new meta dict key and upon doing so it is required the cache
    and meta be cleared.  This version will automate clearing those for you.[/I]
