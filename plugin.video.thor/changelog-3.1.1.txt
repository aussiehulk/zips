[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.1.1 - June 18, 2021[/COLOR][/B]
- Used Venom's update to improve source scraping and selection
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting to "Sources Options" called "Terminate on Cloud Sources".  Now if cloud
    sources are found you can force the scrape process to terminate.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Resume dialog now utilizes the Kodi Matrix/19 new "yesnocustom" dialog.  Matrix users can
    now chose from "Start from Beginning", "Resume" or "Cancel Playback". Leia users
    can only see the first two options[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I regret to inform user that the next release will drop Kodi 18 support.  I no longer desire to
    maintain code to which I will never use again.  The Venom repo will be updated so
    Kodi 18 users can still access an 18 version, but it will no longer be developed.
    Matrix users will have access to a new github branch for future development.[/I]

    for "Default movie/episode) select action".  This has a new ID and is need to be saved to
    the userdata settings.xml.[/I]

    the required artwork for the skin.  From widgets, or inside Venom, there will be no overhead
    added as the needed meta is already available.  If you are a library user the needed meta is
    now pulled from the Kodi db so I encourage you to use the TMDb scraper, from the official
    Kodi repo, and enable fanart.tv for the extended artwork, which I pull out of the db during
    this process.[/I]

    watched when it is not.  This is more an AuraMod bug workaround.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The above item has added a new meta dict key and upon doing so it is required the cache
    and meta be cleared.  This version will automate clearing those for you.[/I]
